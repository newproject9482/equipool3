# 🔧 Authentication Fix: Token-Based System

## Problem Solved

The debug output clearly showed that **no cookies were being sent** from the browser to the backend (`'cookies': {}`). This is a common issue with cross-origin session cookies due to browser security restrictions.

## Solution: Hybrid Authentication System

I've implemented a **token-based authentication system** that works alongside the existing session system:

### 🎯 How It Works

1. **Login**: Returns both session cookie (for same-origin) and auth token (for cross-origin)
2. **API Requests**: Send `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header automatically
3. **Backend**: Checks token first, falls back to session if no token

### 📁 Files Modified

#### Backend Changes:
- `server/models.py` - Added `AuthToken` model
- `server/views.py` - Token creation and validation logic
- `server/migrations/0004_authtoken.py` - Database migration

#### Frontend Changes:
- `client/src/utils/auth.ts` - New authentication utilities
- `client/src/components/LoginModal.tsx` - Store auth token on login
- `client/src/app/pools/page.tsx` - Use token-based requests

### 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. **Push the changes** to your repository
2. **Railway will auto-deploy** the backend with new migration
3. **Redeploy your frontend** (Vercel) to get the new auth system

### 🧪 Testing

After deployment, the authentication flow will be:

1. **Login** → Receives token and stores it locally
2. **API calls** → Automatically include `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
3. **Backend** → Validates token and authorizes requests

### 🔍 Debug Verification

You should now see in Railway logs:
```
[DEBUG] Auth token created: abc123-def456-...
[DEBUG] User authenticated via token: 1 (borrower)
```

Instead of the previous empty session errors.

### 🛡️ Security Features

- **Token expiration**: 7 days automatic expiry
- **Token cleanup**: Old tokens removed on new login
- **Dual fallback**: Session cookies still work for same-origin requests
- **Secure headers**: Proper CORS and security headers maintained

### 📋 What This Fixes

✅ **Pool creation authentication** - Now works cross-origin  
✅ **Persistent login** - No more session loss between requests  
✅ **API reliability** - Consistent authentication across all endpoints  
✅ **Cross-origin support** - Works with your Vercel → Railway setup  

### 🔄 Rollback Plan

If needed, the system maintains backward compatibility:
- Session-based auth still works for existing users
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Can disable token auth by removing Authorization header

---

**Result**: Your pool creation should now work perfectly on your hosted website! 🎉
