# Pool Creation Authentication Debug Guide

## Summary of Changes Made

I've identified and addressed the main issue with your pool creation authentication:

### 1. Environment Variable Configuration
- **Issue**: Your `.env.local` file had the production backend URL commented out
- **Fixed**: Uncommented the production URL: `https://equipool3-production.up.railway.app`
- **Location**: `client/.env.local`

### 2. Added Debug Logging
I've added comprehensive console logging to help you debug the authentication flow:

- Authentication check debugging in `useEffect`
- Pool creation request debugging 
- Pool fetching debugging

## How to Debug the Issue

### Step 1: Check Environment Variables
1. Verify your production deployment has the correct `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`
2. For Vercel deployment, ensure the environment variable is set in your Vercel dashboard
3. Check the browser dev tools console for debug messages showing which URL is being used

### Step 2: Check Browser Console
Open browser dev tools and look for these debug messages:
```
[DEBUG] Checking authentication with URL: https://equipool3-production.up.railway.app/api/auth/me
[DEBUG] Auth check response status: 200
[DEBUG] Auth check response data: {authenticated: true, ...}
```

If you see authentication failures, it means:
- The session cookies aren't being sent properly
- The backend URL is incorrect
- There are CORS issues

### Step 3: Check Network Tab
In browser dev tools, check the Network tab for:
1. `/api/auth/me` request - should return 200 with `authenticated: true`
2. `/api/pools/create` request - should return 201 on success
3. Check if cookies are being sent with requests

### Step 4: Verify Backend Deployment
1. Test the backend directly: `https://equipool3-production.up.railway.app/api/auth/me`
2. Ensure your Railway backend is running and accessible
3. Check Railway logs for any errors

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Environment Variable Not Set
**Symptoms**: Console shows `http://localhost:8000` in production
**Solution**: Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://equipool3-production.up.railway.app` in your deployment environment

### Issue 2: CORS/Cookie Issues
**Symptoms**: Authentication works but pool creation fails with 401
**Solution**: Verify CORS settings in Django `settings.py` include your frontend domain

### Issue 3: Session Cookie Problems
**Symptoms**: Authentication check fails, cookies not sent
**Solution**: Ensure `credentials: 'include'` is in all fetch requests (already implemented)

## Files Modified

1. `client/.env.local` - Fixed environment variable
2. `client/src/app/pools/page.tsx` - Added debug logging

## Next Steps

1. Deploy these changes to your hosting platform
2. Open browser dev tools and check console messages
3. Test pool creation and monitor the debug output
4. If issues persist, share the console log output for further debugging

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to switch back to localhost for development:
```bash
# In client/.env.local, comment out production URL and uncomment local:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://equipool3-production.up.railway.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
```
